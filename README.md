# ðŸŒ¾ AI-Based Rice Growth & Yield Monitoring System â€” Mwea Irrigation Scheme

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project is an **AI-powered forecasting and monitoring system** for rice production in the **Mwea Irrigation Scheme (Kenya)**.  
It integrates historical yield data with environmental and geospatial features (e.g., NDVI, rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, EVI, NDWI, DEM, etc.)  
to forecast **monthly rice yield (tonnes)** up to **December 2030**.

Developed with:
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Machine Learning (LightGBM)**
- **Statistical Time-Series (SARIMAX)**
- **Interactive Visualization (Streamlit, Plotly, Folium)**
- **Geospatial Analysis (Rasterio, GeoPandas)**
